CDBaby Sales Data Crawler - This Eclipse JAVA application is used to 
autmatically login to a CDBaby artist account and web crawl and download 
all of the account sales data. This software was built because CDBaby 
has no way for automatic machine to machine communication/retrieval of 
detailed sales data information, which we need in order to figure out the 
royalties we owe our affiliated artists.

We have asked CDBaby to implement machine to machine communication on 
multiple occasions but their development team has said that is not in 
any of their current or future development plans.  So until then, we will
continue to use and update this software as necessary.

To Run the GUI Application:
>> java -jar bin/SalesDataCrawlerUI.jar
